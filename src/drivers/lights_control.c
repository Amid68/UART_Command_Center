 * @brief Low-level driver for controlling lights.
 * 
 * Description:
 * ------------
 * This file implements the low-level driver interface for controlling lights 
 * in the UART Command Center application. It provides functions to turn lights 
 * on/off and adjust brightness levels. The design aims to:
 *
 * - Abstraction: Higher layers (e.g., command_lights.c) do not need hardware details.
 * - Maintainability: Clear, well-structured code with extensive commenting ensures 
 *   that future contributors can easily understand and modify the behavior.
 * - Professional Standards: Following Zephyr best practices, using Zephyr APIs, 
 *   and employing robust logging for debug and traceability.
 *
 * Current Implementation:
 * -----------------------
 * This initial version implements placeholder logic. Actual hardware integration 
 * (e.g., controlling GPIO pins or PWM for brightness) can be added later.
 * Functions currently return success (0) without performing real hardware actions. 
 * As the project evolves, these placeholders can be replaced with real drivers 
 * or board-specific configurations.
 *
 * Future Improvements:
 * --------------------
 * - Integrate with actual GPIO or PWM drivers for LED control.
 * - Store and validate brightness levels.
 * - Handle error conditions and return meaningful error codes.
 * - Add configuration parameters (e.g., maximum brightness, fade times).
